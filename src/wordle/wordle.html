        <p class="text-secondary">Wordle is a popular guessing game, 
            which was recently acquired by the New York Times.
             Each game has a hidden word that players must guess in 6 tries or less. 
             On each try, the game will reveal how close the guess was to the actual answer. 
             Since I started playing, I have wondered 
            if there was a strategy could always win the game. </p>
